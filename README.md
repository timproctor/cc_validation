cc_validation
=============

The input is a 16 digit credit card (sorry Amex won't work). The output is TRUE or FALSE

based on whether the input passes Luhn Algorithm. I believe that this method 

can cut down on human error at the User Input level. This method won't tell you if the 

User has money on the card but it will tell you if the User has entered a valid credit

card number.
